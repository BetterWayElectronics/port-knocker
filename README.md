# port-knocker
This program allows knock on ports in order to reveal an SSH hidden behind the knockd service. Written in perl and compiled for Win64, it allows more users to access this ability (as far as I know there is no Windows application to do this). I have decided against CLI inputs given I was going to compile it and thus you will be prompted for inputs. Enter ports seperated by spaces in the sequence you wish to knock them in (example: 1337 1000 4444). Not entering anything for 'Delay' and 'SSH Port' will result in a 0.5 second delay and port 22. I will release a version of this with brute forcing capabilities in the future.
