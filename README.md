# port-knocker
This program allows you to gain access to the ability to knock on ports in order to access SSH hidden behind the knockd service. Written in perl and compiled for Win32 it allows more users to access this ability. I have decided against CLI inputs given I was going to compile it and so you will be prompted for inputs. Not entering anything for 'Delay' and 'SSH Port' will result in a 0.5 second delay and port 22. I will release a version of this with brute forcing capabilities in the future.
